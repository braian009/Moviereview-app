# Moviereview-app
A movie review app where the user can navigate from the main page to specific movie's page where they can leave a review or edit an existing one if they are logged in user. There is a news page too, in which one can visualize them in card format. 
The project was made to gain experience in django, but more specific in turn functionality from function views (thing that I am not familiarized with) to class based views, thing that made me recognize more logic behind the views and to realize that CBV are more consistance and definetly the best apprach for me. So it was kind of a challenge.
